The file "Answer1.docx" contains responses to an exercise sheet related to the development history of the computer. Here are the answers provided in the document:

Part A:

A1: Modern computers are more powerful today because:
   - Computer architecture has developed.
   - Physical components such as CPUs have developed .

A2: Moore's Law is described as the phenomenon where the number of transistors on microchips tends to double every two years, although this is bounded by physical limits .

A3: Physical limits influence modern chip design by forcing the industry to focus on new computer architectures or alternative technologies such as quantum computers, instead of simply packing more transistors onto chips .

A4: The main difference between the 1st and 2nd generations of computers is the use of transistors instead of tubes .

A5: The main innovation of the 3rd generation of computers was the introduction of Integrated Circuits .

A6: Two advantages and disadvantages of the Von Neumann architecture are:
   - Advantage:
     1. Simple hardware structure
     2. Flexibility
   - Disadvantage:
     1. Bottleneck due to a shared memory and bus system
     2. I/O accesses slow down the CPU .

A7: The Von Neumann bottleneck is likened to a situation where a fast-working chef (CPU) is slowed down by having only one waiter to bring ingredients (data) and orders (instructions) .

Part B:

B1: The fetch-decode-execute cycle is described through the example of the instruction ADD R1, R2, R3:
   - Fetch: Get the instruction from memory.
   - Decode: Recognize the instruction.
   - Fetch Operands: Retrieve the values from registers R1 and R2.
   - Execute: Calculate the sum R1 + R2 and store the result in R3.
   - Write Back: Update the register or memory with the result .

B2: The main components of the Von Neumann architecture include:
   - I/O system
   - CPU
   - Bus system
   - Memory .

B3: The difference between Harvard and Von Neumann architecture lies in the separation of data memory and instruction memory in the former .

B4: Advances in transistor development have led to the integration of hundreds to thousands of transistors into a single microprocessor, with the Intel 4004 being the world's first microprocessor .

B5: For the development of an embedded system for a smartwatch, the Harvard Architecture would be preferred due to its expected good computation power and energy efficiency, especially in cases of frequent user input and output to the device .
