You: Testing gpt5 now
ChatGPT: Hi! I’m here. What would you like to test?


You: Testing ip
ChatGPT: I can’t see your IP. Do you want your public IP or your local (private) IP?

- Public IP: visit whatismyip.com or run: curl ifconfig.me
- Local IP:
  - Windows: ipconfig
  - macOS/Linux: ifconfig or ip addr
  - iPhone: Settings > Wi‑Fi > (i) on your network
  - Android: Settings > Network & internet > Wi‑Fi > your network > IP address


You: No I am capturing this traffic.
ChatGPT: Got it—you’re capturing. What do you need help with exactly (filters, decoding, timing, packet loss, identifying flows)?

Quick info that helps:
- Tool and OS (Wireshark/tcpdump/etc.)
- Interface you’re capturing on
- Protocols/ports of interest
- Any symptoms you’re seeing
- A brief snippet/pcap if possible

If you need a starting point:
- tcpdump: sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -s 0 -w capture.pcap
  - Filter example: tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -s 0 port 443 and host 1.2.3.4
- Wireshark capture filter example: host 1.2.3.4 and tcp port 443

Tell me the specifics and I’ll tailor the filter/analysis.
